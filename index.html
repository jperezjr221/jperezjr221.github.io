### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite since it required us to use math logic-related variables and formulas to create a function. I was able to calculate the pizza's unit cost, which came out to be dollars per square inch. In the end, it helps customers in deciding which pizza offers the most value overall. I was always good at math since i was a kid, so it's a strong factor of mine. And to see that we used math in coding made this specific lab stand out to me.
    

* Lab 4

    Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because it's about building a program that involves the two partners in a high/low number guessing game. Now I was able to succesfully build this program because I had a partner who helped me with perfect my writing the if statements. This lab was challenging at first but it also helped me better my coding skills and prepared me for the future labs that were more challenging. 

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because I always interested in playing cards but I just didn't know the rules and know how each card represented a certain value. This lab made me find a way to create a function that determined a blackjack hand's correct value regardless of the number of aces given. So just from this lab it gave me a better understanding on how Blackjack works in a way.
